[Version 3.0](/NTPoly/downloads) of NTPoly is now available.

Going from version 2.7 to 3.0 includes the following changes.

Version upped to 3 because of a significant change to the density matrix
solver interfaces (not because there are a ton of new features). Basically,
instead of an integer for the number of electrons, it now takes in a float
which is the trace of the density matrix you want. This clarifies some of 
the factors of two issues, and leaves room for partial occupancy.

Additionally, to make the `SolverParameters_t` objects, you should now call
`ConstructSolverParameters`.

Features:

* Floating point number for number of electrons
* IsIdentity routine
* Similarity transform helper
* McWeeny step helper
* Reduce dimension feature
* Maps with integer optional data
* Should avoid assign alloc everywhere, including data types, using proper copy routines for all derived types.
* Print the process grid information.
* Fix integer out of bounds potential issue in I/O.
* Eigensolver based dense fallback for most routines.
* Wave operator minimization method.

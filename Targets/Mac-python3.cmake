# Target file for a Mac computer.
# Unfortunately, installing on the mac is a bit tricky. The problem is that
# when you install SWIG, it might link against the wrong version of python.
# That's why I've included custom set variables for the python framework,
# include path, etc. These come from using Homebrew with default settings.
# You might need to adjust based on your brew path (in this case /usr/local)
# and the version of python you have installed.

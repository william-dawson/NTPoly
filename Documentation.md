* [3.0 C++ Documentation](../doc/3.0/CPP/index.html)
* [3.0 Python](../doc/3.0/python/index.html)

For legacy purposes, we also maintain documentation of the final version 2.0
and 1.0 series release:

* [2.7 Fortran Documentation](../doc/2.7/Fortran/index.html)
* [2.7 C++ Documentation](../doc/2.7/CPP/index.html)

And the version submitted to Computer Physics Communications:

## Local Documentation

To build local documentation, after building NTPoly stay in the Build directory
and type:
